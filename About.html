		<p class="aboutUsDescription">
			Our family started back in 1992 in a cramped old building
			with barely any character to it. It wasn't easy in the beginning, 
			but over the years word got out to many who live in South 
			Carolina that there is a truly authentic Italian experience to be
			had with everyone here at Carolina Restaurant. As our customer base
			grew so did our determination to bring the best experience to everyone
			who walked through our doors, whether they are long time veterains of
			of our eatery, or someone who just walked in the door for the first time.
